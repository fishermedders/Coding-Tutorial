#Introduction
This week is about PHP. This doesn't have to be followed day by day. I don't care if you binge code, I won't judge :)))

Anyways, the prerequisites are:
XAMPP - How you will host your website. https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
Either Notepad or any other IDE (I recommend Notepad++ https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.9.html) - Your file editor.

PHP is a behind the scenes scripting language in which your webserver interprets to send information to the client (web browser).
PHP can do lots of things, Including Network functions, File functions, Browser functions, and can echo out other types of
code. It also has alot of the standard libraries that other coding languages have, which makes it easy to use.
If you haven't learned HTML and the structure of HTML, you should, although it is not a requirement.

#TL;DR:
PHP is a very useful language, you should know HTML, not required, though.
